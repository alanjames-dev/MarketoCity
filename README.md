# MarketoCity | A team init5 Project

**Marketocity** is an online platform that focuses on developing the rural economy by providing an innovative way to do business. It follows the principle of direct selling where the sellers would directly sell their produce to the consumers, without any middlemen. It would ensure better pay and better value to their products, which in turn would contribute to the overall development of villages. Sellers can manage their own storefronts and no investment has to be made for physical storefronts.
